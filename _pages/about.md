My name is Jian Wang. I am an Associate Professor with a research focus on spatial data mining and its applications in geosciences, particularly in quantitative mineral prediction and uncertainty evaluation. I am honored to be a Fellow of the Association of Applied Geochemists, a life member of the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences, and a member of the young editorial board for the Journal of Chengdu University of Technology (Science & Technology Edition).

My academic work includes leading several research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Program. I have published over 30 papers in respected scientific journals, including one ESI Highly Cited Paper. Additionally, I have co-authored a monograph and hold two national invention patents and three software copyrights.
