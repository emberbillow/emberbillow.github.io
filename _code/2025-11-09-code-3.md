This tool generates spatially correlated data using Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. The method creates stationary Gaussian random fields without trend effects. 

Parameters: Select a variogram model (Exponential/Gaussian/Spherical), set the range (spatial correlation distance), sill (total variance), and nugget (micro-scale variation). The algorithm computes the covariance matrix C, performs Cholesky decomposition C=LLT, generates independent standard normal variables z, and produces correlated field values Y=Lz. These are then transformed to lognormal distribution for realistic data. Download the CSV file for kriging exercises in geostatistics courses.
