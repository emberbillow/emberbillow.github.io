Local Singularity Analysis (LSA) is a powerful, non-linear technique used in geochemical data analysis to identify and characterize anomalous spatial patterns in element concentrations, particularly those associated with mineralization processes. It moves beyond traditional global statistical methods by focusing on the local scaling properties of geochemical distributions at specific locations.

The core principle of LSA is rooted in multifractal theory. It quantifies how element concentrations change across different spatial scales around a given point. The key output is the singularity exponent (α), calculated for each location (e.g., sample point or grid cell). This exponent measures the rate of change in concentration as the scale (area or volume) around the point changes.

- α = 2: Indicates "normal" background behavior where concentration remains stable across scales (homogeneous dispersion).

- α < 2: Signifies a singularity or anomaly. This represents a concentration increase when moving to finer scales (e.g., element enrichment at the point). Values significantly less than 2 often point to strong potential mineralization.

- α > 2: Indicates a concentration decrease at finer scales (e.g., element depletion).
