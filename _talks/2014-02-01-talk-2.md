A multiplicative cascade process is a method for generating multifractal distributions, which are common in fields like turbulence and finance to model intermittent and highly irregular phenomena. The process is iterative and builds a fractal-like structure by progressively dividing a space and distributing a measure, such as energy or mass, among the new subdivisions.

The process begins with an initial uniform space or interval. In each step, this space is divided into smaller segments. A set of random multipliers, whose average is typically one, is then applied to redistribute the measure from the parent segment to its new child segments. For example, a parent interval might be split into two halves, with one-half receiving a fraction $m_1$ of the original measure and the other receiving $m_2$, where $m_1 + m_2$ is not necessarily equal to 1.

This recursive procedure continues for several levels. The resulting distribution is not a simple fractal but a multifractal, meaning different regions of the space scale according to different power laws. This complex scaling behavior is characterized by a spectrum of fractal dimensions rather than a single value, capturing the rich, heterogeneous structure generated by the cascade.
