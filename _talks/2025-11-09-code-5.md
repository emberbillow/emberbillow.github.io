This sophisticated browser-based application transforms user-uploaded CSV files into trainable datasets for neural network classification, enabling seamless end-to-end ML workflows without coding or servers. Designed for real-world data, it handles tabular inputs with headers: upload a training CSV (with label column) and an optional prediction CSV (features only), automatically parsing via PapaParse for robust CSV support, filtering empty rows, and previewing samples in interactive tables.
Variable selection is intuitive—choose multiple feature columns (predictors) and a single response (label) column via multi-select dropdowns, ensuring no overlap. The platform auto-detects feature count and unique classes, supporting up to 5 hidden layers configurable as JSON arrays (e.g., [64, 32, 16]), with activations (ReLU, Tanh, etc.), dropout, learning rates, and optimizers. Training splits data (default 80/20 validation) for 10-500 epochs, rendering live loss/accuracy plots and metrics, with confusion matrices on validation subsets.
Prediction shines in batch mode: apply the trained model to the uploaded CSV, appending 'Predicted Class' and 'Confidence' columns, previewing results in a scrollable table (first 20 rows), and downloading enhanced CSVs via one-click. For 2D data, scatter plots visualize class distributions. Client-side execution with WebGL ensures privacy and speed, handling datasets up to thousands of rows. Ideal for data scientists, analysts, or domain experts in fields like healthcare or finance, this tool democratizes neural classification—upload, select, train, predict, and export in minutes, bridging raw data to actionable insights with elegant, responsive UI.
