This interactive web-based platform empowers users to build, train, and evaluate fully connected neural networks for multi-class classification tasks. At its core is a versatile data generation module supporting four classic datasets: Iris (4 features, 3 classes), concentric circles (2 features, 2 classes), spiral arms (2 features, 3 classes), and XOR problem (2 features, 2 classes). Users can customize parameters like sample sizes (50-2000 for training, 20-500 for testing) and noise levels (0-0.5) to simulate realistic variations, fostering experimentation with non-linearly separable data.
The workflow is streamlined into four steps: generate and preview data with scatter plots for 2D visualizations and tabular previews; configure the model with two hidden layers (8-256 units each), activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid, ELU), dropout (0-0.5), learning rates (0.001-0.1), and optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop); train for 10-500 epochs with batch sizes (8-128), monitoring real-time loss/accuracy curves via Chart.js and key metrics; and perform single predictions with manual feature inputs or random tests from the test set, displaying class probabilities as interactive bars.
A standout feature is the CSV export button, allowing seamless download of generated training and testing datasets as separate files (e.g., train_data.csv, test_data.csv) with headers for features and labels—ideal for offline analysis or integration with other tools. Post-training, a confusion matrix visualizes performance on test data. No backend required; all computations run client-side with WebGL acceleration for efficiency. This tool is perfect for educators, students, and ML enthusiasts exploring neural networks without setup hassles, promoting hands-on learning in a visually engaging interface.
